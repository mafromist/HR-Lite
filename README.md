The application should consist of the functionality below:
## Requirements: 
- List all employee records
- Add a new employee record
- Edit an existing employee record
- Delete an existing employee record

## Additional Requirements: 
- Create a navigation menu web component for allowing the user to navigate between the different pages of the application.
- Integrate a router and configurate the appropriate routes for navigation. You can use Vaadin Router for this or any other router you like.
- Design each component/page of the application to be viewed both in desktop mode and in responsive mode without any flaws. You're forbidden to use any responsive css libraries like Bootstrap.
- Implement a state management mechanism to persist data in the browser memory since you won't have a backend to work with for persistence. You can use a 3rd party library like Redux or can come up with your own solution for this.
- Add the localization support to your web components for Turkish and English languages. You can read the localization setting from the root html's lang attribute for this.
- Add detailed unit tests for each web component and the functionality you create. The coverage ratio must be at least 85%.
- Please use the LitElement's JavaScript version for creating the application as stated in the description above.
